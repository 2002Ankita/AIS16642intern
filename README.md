# AIS16642intern
Task1:
1.Variable declaration rule: Studied the rules for variables declaration of variable.
2.Operators: Studied various operators in python like Arithmetic,logical,comparision,numeric,identity ,Menbership and bitwise.
Datatypes:
3.List-Studied how to declare datatype  list and its method like append,remove,insert,pop,sort,count,accesing,copy,reverse and its properties.
4.Tuple:Studied how to declare tuple and its method like index,count,etc.
5.Set:Set declaration and its properties like mutable,ordered etc.
6.Dictionary:declaration of dictionary,methods like copy,index pop and use of for loop accesing.
7.String:declaration of string
8.Number:int,float and complex.
Also difference between list and tuple and difference between dictionary and set.


Task2:
1.if stmt:use of if statement to check a single condition in various examples i.e to check whethere the number is positive,negative,odd,even  within a specific range etc..
2.if else stmt: used to check two conditions in example like number is odd or even,pos or neg etc.
3.if elif else:to test multiple condition at a time if above condition false then next condition is tested.examples like result of student.
4.For loop:used to iterate over sequence of items.
5 While loop: used to repeatedly execute  a block of statement while a condition is true.


Task3:
In task 3 we studied the break ,pass,continue statement also we studies User defined functions like Stattistical(mean,median,mode,etc) and logical(odd,even,grades).
#break-Functionality: When break is encounterd inside loop,the loop stops its execution and control is transferred to the statement immediatelyfollowing the loop.
Use case: It is useful when you want to exist a loop as soon as certain condition is met,avoidin unnecessary iterations.#Continue functionality: When continue is encountered,the current iteration is terminated,and the loop proceed with the next iteration.Use Case: It is useful when you want to skip over some parts of the loop but continue with the nextiterations.For instance ,you might want to skip over even numbers or any specific condition within a loop.#pass functionality:The pass statement does nothing and is used as a placeholder.Use case:It is useful when a statement is synthetically required ,but you do not want any action to be taken.Commonly used during development as a placeholder for future code ,in empty function or class definations,or within conditional statements where you plan to add code later.#Statistical User-Defined Functions-Statistical functions are essentials for data analysis and help summarize and understand the data's property.Mean is used to calculate average of list of numbers.Median is use to find the middle value of a list numbers.mode is used to find the most frequently occuring values in a list numbers.Variance used to measure spread of numbers  in a list from the mean. Standard deviation is used to measure the amount  of variation or dispersion of set of values .Percentile is used to determine the value below which a given percentage of obsevations fall range is used to calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a list . interquartile Range(IQR) is used to measure middle 50% of the data .Covariance is used to measure how two variables change together.Correlation Coefficient  used to measure the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables.#Logical User Defined Functions:#is even purpose: Check if a number is even .#is_odd_Purpose:Check if number is odd#Check if number is prime # Check palindrome purpose etc.


Task4:
 In task 4 we studied all about Numpy library.Starting with a basic introduction and ends up with creating and plotting random data sets,and working with NumPy functions.#NumPy is open sourse project that enables numerical computing with python. numPy will always be 100% open source software and free for all use. We studied 1)creating arrays ,2)array indexing 3)slicing 4)NumPy datatypes 5) copy or view 6)array shape or reshape 7) array iterating,8)join,split,searh,sort and filter.Here 1D array,3D array and multidimensional array are studied.
 NumPy has some extra data types,and refer to data types with one character like i for integers,u for unsigned integers etc.#Then we learn how to generate Random Number.Numpy offers the random module to work with random numbers.#Data disribution is a list of all possible values,and how often each value occurs.Such lists are important when working with statistics and data scince.The random module offer methods that return randomly generated data distributions.Then we see that generation of random numbers from particular distribution and visuallisation of that distribution,like normal distribution,bimomial,poisson,uniform,logistic,multinomial,exponentialchi-square etc To plot the graph of distribution#from NumPy import random# import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # impor seaborn as sns .Then we use ufuncs stands for "Universal Functions" and they are NumPy functions that operate on the ndarray object.We studied ufunctions like simple arithmetic,roundin decimals,logs,summations,products,differences,finding lcm,gcd,trignometric functions,hyperbolic functions and set operations.

Task5:
In task 5 we studied pandas library in python.
#Pandas Series:A Pandas Series is like a column in a table.
It is a one-dimensional array holding data of any type.We can also use a key/value object, like a dictionary, when creating a Series.
#DataFrames
Data sets in Pandas are usually multi-dimensional tables, called DataFrames.
Series is like a column, a DataFrame is the whole table.We also studied how to read csv and xlsx file in python.We create DataFrame using matrix and dictionary.
We also studied DataFrame operations like value counts,apply unique,nunique,describe,head,tail and info.
We studied how to select perticular row ,column in python,We also studied conditional selection, addding ,deleting and updating a perticular column,indexing and remove indexing.How to use operations like addition,substraction,multiplication,division between two columns.
We studied checking of missing values in data,studied missing values drop by row and by columns also studied filling of missing values by using mean and median.
